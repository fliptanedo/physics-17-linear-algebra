## How to use this

For those, like me, are less competent with `git` and GitHub than we really aught to be.

1. Go to repo's [page]( https://github.com/fliptanedo/paper-template-2022) on GitHub.

2. Click on the green `Code` button just to the top-right of the list of files. 

3. Copy the GitHub Command Line Interface (CLI) code:

   ```
   gh repo clone fliptanedo/paper-template-2022
   ```

4. Locally (on your system) go to the parent directory of where you'd like to start a new LaTeX project and open a Terminal (command prompt) window there. Assuming you have `git` set up, you can simply type in

   ```
   gh repo clone fliptanedo/paper-template-2022
   ```

5. and press enter.

6. This should create a new folder `paper-template-2022`. Go ahead and rename it right away:

   ```
   mv paper-template-2022 new-folder-name
   ```

7. Go ahead and start your new project.
